# Unsupervised Learning

This module contains unsupervised learning algorithms implemented from scratch.

These algorithms discover structure in unlabeled data.

## Algorithms Included

- k-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Community Detection

## Design Notes

- Algorithms emphasize structural correctness
- Deterministic behavior where applicable
- No reliance on downstream supervised models
