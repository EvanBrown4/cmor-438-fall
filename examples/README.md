# Examples

This folder contains **fully worked, educational examples** demonstrating how to use the algorithms in `rice_ml`.

Each example is designed to:
- Build intuition for the algorithm
- Walk through preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- Show **both good and bad parameter choices**
- Emphasize understanding over raw performance

## Structure

```
examples/
├── Supervised_Learning/
└── Unsupervised_Learning/
```

Each subfolder contains algorithm-specific examples with accompanying visualizations.

## How to Run

All examples are written as **Jupyter notebooks**.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate into the desired folder and open the notebook.

## Notes

- These examples implement the models from this package only.
- Random seeds are fixed for reproducibility
