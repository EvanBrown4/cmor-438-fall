# Unsupervised Learning Examples

This folder contains example notebooks for **unsupervised learning algorithms** implemented in the `rice_ml` package.
These examples focus on discovering structure, patterns, or representations in data **without labeled targets**.

The notebooks emphasize intuition, visualization, and qualitative evaluation, alongside quantitative metrics where appropriate.

## Algorithms Included

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  A dimensionality reduction technique that projects data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much variance as possible.

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  A centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into a fixed number of clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance.

- **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)**  
  A density-based clustering algorithm that groups points based on local density and identifies outliers as noise.

- **Community Detection**  
  Graph-based algorithms that identify densely connected subgroups within a network, often used in social, biological, or interaction graphs.

## When to Use These Algorithms

Unsupervised learning algorithms are appropriate when:
- You do **not** have labeled output data
- The goal is to explore structure, patterns, or relationships in the data
- You want to reduce dimensionality, cluster observations, or analyze graph structure

Common use cases include:
- **PCA** for visualization, noise reduction, or preprocessing before supervised learning
- **K-Means** for partitioning data into interpretable groups when the number of clusters is known
- **DBSCAN** for discovering arbitrarily shaped clusters and detecting outliers
- **Community Detection** for analyzing network structure and relational data

## How to Navigate

Each algorithm has its own subfolder containing:
- A short **README** describing the algorithm and example setup
- One or more **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating:
  - Data preparation
  - Algorithm intuition and parameters
  - Model fitting and results
  - Visualizations and interpretation
- Any **supporting plots or figures** generated by the notebooks

Because unsupervised learning often lacks ground-truth labels, many examples rely heavily on visualization and qualitative analysis.

Notebooks are designed to be read sequentially and include explanatory markdown alongside code.
