    "    DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points\n",
    "    that are closely packed (high density regions) and marks points in low-density\n",
    "    regions as outliers (noise). Unlike K-means, DBSCAN does not require specifying\n",
    "    the number of clusters beforehand and can discover clusters of arbitrary shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The algorithm identifies three types of points:\n",
    "    - **Core points**: Points that have at least `min_samples` neighbors within\n",
    "      distance `eps` (including themselves).\n",
    "    - **Border points**: Points that are within distance `eps` of a core point\n",
    "      but don't have enough neighbors to be core points themselves.\n",
    "    - **Noise points**: Points that are neither core nor border points, labeled\n",
    "      as -1."
